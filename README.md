# pstoedit-plotter
pstoedit with g-code module modified for my plotter

Miraculously, I managed to get this all to work on my Mac.
I have modified the file /src/dvgcode.cpp to output g-code file appropriate to my pen plotter.
It is otherwise a normal, and functional version of the pstoedit command line app.

This is designed to work with the Brew package manager. I have a Brew formula that sucessfully installs it (at least on my machines) elsewhere in my Git repos. 

I barely know what I'm doing so don't be suprised if something is funky....
